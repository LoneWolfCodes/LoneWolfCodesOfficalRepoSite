    "first": "Lone Wolf Codes was founded on the “LONE WOLF PHILOSOPHY” meaning that every freelancer is an individual, or as I like to refer to us Lone Wolfs.",
    "second": "Whereas most wolves hunt in a pack, lone wolves hunt alone, the same way most people work in an organisation, freelancers work alone. It’s not uncommon that some lone wolfs come across each and work together for a short while as freelancers would, but in the end, we are still our businesses."
